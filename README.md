# *** MY FIRST CALCULATOR *** .py
I Initially Saw [Al Sweigart](https://github.com/asweigart)'s [my_first_tic_tac_toe](https://github.com/asweigart/my_first_tic_tac_toe) & Was Amused.
I Then Saw The Image Shown Below Posted On Reddit. Assuming That The Image Was Not Made Up For Some Fake Internet Points & Also Assuming That Their 
Friend Only Used Addition, Subtraction, Multiplication & Division Then The Number Of Numbers That They Would Have If Statements For Would Be...

    sqrt(9500/4) = 48.7339...
    sqrt(9500/4) â‰ˆ 50 

So To Be True To The "Real" Story I Have Only Gone From 0-50 However Higher Numbers Can Easily Be Generated Too However My PythonCrashes With Larger Numbers.
I Generated One That Was 0-10 & It Took Up 317 MB Of Space On My Hard Drive But Was Only 20MB After I Compressed It To A .rar So I Have Also Attached It.

The Generator Will Not Work In Python 2 However It Can Probably Be Patched To Work By Doing `from __future__ import division`
